                                <h4>IRS Extension Form 7004</h4>
                                <p>Form 7004 provides an extension for businesses to file their tax return. However, any
                                    tax owed must be paid by the applicable tax return due date. Form 7004 provides an
                                    extension of time to file a tax return but does not provide an extension to pay any
                                    tax owed to the IRS. Failure to pay any owed tax will result in a penalty of a ½% of
                                    any tax not paid by the due date and is charged for each month or part of a month
                                    that the tax remains unpaid. The penalty can be as high as 25% of the amount due.
                                    The penalty will not be charged if you can show reasonable cause for not paying any
                                    owed tax on time.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Form 7004 generally extends the period of time to file to 6 months.</li>
                                    <li> Exceptions apply for certain filers of Form 1041 and for C corporations with

                                <p>Form 4868 allows individuals, Sole proprietors (Schedule C), and Single-member LLCs
                                    including independent contractors to request more time to gather all the documents
                                    to file their tax returns. The extension Form provides a 6-month extension if 90% or
                                    more of their owed tax is payable by April 18th.</p>
                                <p> Form 4868 extends your filing deadline to October 15th of the annual tax year. Don’t
                                    file Form 4868 if you want the IRS to figure out your tax or under a court order to
                                    file your return by the regular due date. All tax owed must be paid on or before
                                    April 18th regardless if an extension was requested. Failure to pay owed tax may
                                    result in a penalty from the IRS.</p>
                                <p>Form 4868 provides an extension to file a tax return but does not provide an
                                    extension to pay any tax owed. You can pay any owed tax online with a direct
                                    transfer from your bank account using Direct Pay, the Electronic Federal Tax Payment
                                    System, or by debit or credit card. You can also pay by phone using the Electronic

                                <h4>990-N (Tax-exempt E-postcard)</h4>
                                <p>Form 990-N is used by small tax-exempt organizations that have an annual reporting
                                    requirement and can satisfy the requirements by submitting Form 990-N, Electronic
                                    Notice (e-Postcard.) Form 990-N is submitted electronically, the IRS currently has
                                    no paper Forms to submit Form 990-N.</p>
                                <p> Small tax-exempt organizations generally are eligible to file Form 990-N to satisfy
                                    their annual reporting requirement, if their annual gross receipts are normally
                                    $50,000 or less. A gross receipt is a total amount the organization receives from
                                    all sources during its annual accounting period, without subtracting any costs or
                                    expenses. If the gross receipt is over $50,000, the organization cannot file for
                                    Form 990-N the organization must file Form 990 or a 990-EZ Form. However, if a
                                    subordinate organization in a group exemption that is included in a group return
                                    filed by its central organization, does not need to file Form 990-N because the
                                    group return satisfies its annual reporting requirement.</p>
                                <p> If the organization fails to submit its e-postcard by the due date, the IRS will
                                    send a reminder to the address on file. Non-profit organizations should submit the
                                    required form, even if they are late the IRS will not penalize the organization for
                                    any late submissions. However, the IRS will not apply any late penalties due to
                                    failure of filing an e-postcard but will revoke the organization’s tax-exempt status
                                    if the organization fails to file an e-postcard for three consecutive years. The
                                    revocation of the tax-exempt status will happen after the filing due date of the
                                    third consecutively-missed year. The due date to file Form 990-N is every year by
                                    the 15th day of the 5th month after the close of your tax year. An organization
                                    cannot file an e-Postcard until their tax year ends.</p>

    <h1 class="py-3">The Fastest Way To E-filing Form 1099-G?</h1>

    <p >Form 1099-G is used to report local, state, and federal governments payments made to taxpayers
        during a particular tax year. The filers will receive the form from the government agencies to inform the filers
        of their funds. They will then receive a copy that will be needed to report their federal income tax returns.
        Form 1099-G should be used to calculate the filer&#39;s federal adjusted gross income or report the amount of
        refund
        filer received from a prior tax year. If income is received from Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA)
        payments; taxable grants, agricultural payments, or payments on a Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan then
        it must be reported to the IRS.</p>
    <p>Quantities that do not need to be reported on Form 1099-G, may include compensation for services, prizes, and
        certain incentives, these amounts may be reportable on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Information, or Form
        1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation. 1099-G forms must be mailed to recipients by February 15th and e-filed with
        the IRS by <span class="fw-bold">March 31st</span> each year.</p>

    <h3 class="text-color py-3">Who Uses Form 1099-G?</h3>

    <p>Form 1099-G must be filed when payments for the following have been made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unemployment</li>
        <li>Income tax refunds, credits, or offsets at the state and local levels</li>
        <li>Reemployment trade adjustment assistance (RTAA)</li>
        <li>Taxable grants</li>
        <li>Agricultural payments</li>

        <p>All the copies need to be completed and received by January 31 of the year followed by the tax year. If the
            filer knows they&#39;re a victim and already reported the fraud to the IRS, the IRS will investigate the case.
            However, the filler will not need to submit any additional reports to the IRS. According to the IRS rules,
            an individual that receives UI benefits and does not use them will still receive a 1099-G but can show the
            money as being paid back.</p>

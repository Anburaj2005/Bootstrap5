    <h1 class="py-3">The Fastest Way To E-filing Form 1099-B</h1>

    <p class="py-2">Form 1099-B is used to report broker or barter exchanges to record customers&#39; profits and losses
        during a particular tax year. The filers will receive the form from their brokers or barter exchange already
        filled out. If the filer sold stocks, bonds, or other securities through a broker or had a barter exchange
        transaction, they must receive a Form 1099-B. When the filer redeems any shares, it may result in a taxable gain
        or deductible loss, which must be reported to the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank"><u>IRS.</u></a>
    </p>
    <p class="py-2 mb-5"> Regardless of whether the filler had a gain, loss, or brokage, they must report these
        transactions on their tax return. Late filing of the form leads to penalties ranging from $50 to $280 per 1099
        form. Taxpayers transfer the information from a 1099-B to a Form 8949 to calculate their preliminary gains and
        losses. 1099-B forms must be mailed to recipients by February 15 and e-filed with the IRS by <span class="fw-bold">March 31st</span>  each
        year.</p>

            <p class="pt-3">In preparing Form 1099-B or a transfer statement, the filer must take into account all the information
                reported by the issuer of the security on a statement that the issuer furnishes to them or is deemed to
                furnish to them, unless the issuer statement is incomplete or incorrect. A transaction can include both
                covered and non-covered shares because the redemption can be comprised of multiple purchases.</p>

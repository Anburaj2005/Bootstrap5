    <h1 class="py-3">The Fastest Way To E-filing Form 1099-K</h1>

    <p >With all the <a href="./efile-1099-form" target="_blank"><u>1099 Forms </u></a>are involved in 1099
        filing taxes, it can be difficult to sort out just
        which ones you need to fill out and which ones you don&#39;t. However, if you own a small business and accept
        online
        credit card payments, you need to pay particular attention to the IRS Form 1099-K. In our changing world, this
        newest tax document represents a shift towards online commerce and credit card payments, and there is a lot of
        confusion about whom needs to file and what to do if you receive one.</p>
    <p >The 1099-K Form exists due to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/5720"
            target="_blank"><u>2008 Housing Assistance Tax Act</u></a>. While it has nothing to do with housing, this
        form was created to hold online retailers responsible for reporting sales for tax purposes. Credit card
        companies and third-party processors like <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home?Z3JncnB0=" target="_blank"><u>
                PayPal</u></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><u>Amazon</u></a> are all required
        to report payment transactions on
        behalf of retailers. If you accept credit card payments or run an e-commerce business through a third-party
        processor, you may find a Form 1099-K in the mail. On the 1099-K you will find listed the gross payment card and
        third party network transaction amounts. Both are required by law to be reported to the IRS and an IRS 1099-K is
        one of many documents that are designed to ensure that self-employed persons report their earnings accurately.

        <h3 class="text-color py-3">How to File 1099-K Online?</h3>
        <P>Previously, the income reported on a 1099-K Tax Form was reported on your <a href="../efile-form-1099-misc"
                target="_blank"><u>1099-MISC</u></a> and they were not
            considered different documents. However, after 2008, the two have become separate. Now, the 1099-MISC Form
            is usually used for payments made to independent contractors and self-employed persons, and the 1099-K Form
            is used to accurately report how much money you made from card transactions online. You can file through the
            <a href="../fire-efile-requirements" target="_blank"><u>FIRE (Filing Information Returns Electronically
                    System)</u></a>. If a payment entity has more than 250 individual
            returns to file in any given tax year, they must all be electronically submitted. Payee statements are due
            the <span class="fw-bold">March 31st of every year</span>. If a payee has given consent, they may receive their
            documents electronically,
            although it is standard to mail a paper copy for their records.
        </P>

    <h3 class="text-color py-3">Who Needs to File Form 1099-K?</h3>

    <p >There are two types of organizations that should look to file these 1099-K Tax Form. These organizations are
        Merchant Acquiring entities, a payment settlement entity and a third-party settlement organization in which a
        third-party handles payment between the provider of service and the purchaser.<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/tax-information/tax-documents/" target="_blank"><u>Uber </u></a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/481/how-do-taxes-work-for-hosts" target="_blank"><u>Airbnb</u></a> are two examples
        of third-party settlement organizations. If you work through either of them, you may receive a 1099-K Form.</p>
    <p>However, even if you think you might be a TPSO, you may not need to file an IRS Form 1099-K if you have accounts
        made for a significant number of unrelated parties, an agreement between you and your sellers to settle
        payments, standards and mechanisms for settling transactions and a guarantee that your providers will be paid.
        You also are only required to issue a 1099-K after processing over 200 transactions and you have paid out over
        $20,000 to the payee over the tax year. However, because of the confusion surrounding this new form, some
        organizations have issued 1099-K even though they hadn&#39;t met the requirements. If you are unsure whether you
        need to file one, speak to a tax advisor who can help you get the answers you need about your situation.</p>

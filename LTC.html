    <p >Form 1099-LTC is used to report any long-term care benefits, including accelerated death benefits.
        Payers may include companies, governmental units, and viatical settlement providers during a particular tax
        year. Insurance companies that pay long-term care insurance benefits or life insurance under an accelerated
        death benefits clause are required by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-ltc"
            target="_blank"><u>IRS</u></a> to provide the filers with Form 1099-LTC that reports the tax
        payments made. Payments that are from long-term care insurance contracts are generally excludable as taxable
        income.</p>
    <p>A viatical settlement provider is an individual (or company) that pays the same kind of
        benefits to a person in exchange for being named the beneficiary of that person&#39;s life insurance policy.
    </p>
    <div class="privacy-policy">
        <P>	&#8220;Long-term care benefits&#8221; May indicate:</P>
        <ul>
            <li>Any payments made under a product that is advertised, marketed, or offered as long-term care insurance
                (whether qualified or not);</li>
            <li>Accelerated death benefits (excludable in whole or in part from gross income under section 101(g) paid
                under a life insurance contract or paid by a viatical settlement provider.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1099-LTC forms must be mailed to recipients by February 15 and e-filed with the IRS by <span class="fw-bold">March
                31st</span>each year.</p>

    <h3 class="text-color">Who can use Form 1099-LTC?</h3>
    <p>Common payers who need to file the Form 1099-LTC</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payers of long-term and accelerated death benefits</li>
        <li>Insurance companies</li>
        <li>Governmental units</li>
        <li>Viatical settlement providers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Providers engage in purchasing or taking the assignment of insurance contracts on the lives of terminally or
        chronically ill individuals, and are licensed in the state to insure lives. However, if a doctor has declared
        the beneficiary to be terminally ill or likely to die from the condition within two years (24 month) â€”the
        accelerated death benefits are not taxable with no limitations. There are three copies of the forms: one copy
        for the IRS, one for the Policyholder and one for the insured.</p>

    <p >Form 1099-Q, (Payments from Qualified Education Programs) is an <a
            href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-q" target="_blank"><u>IRS (Internal Revenue
                Service)</u></a> form sent to individuals who receive distributions from a Coverdell Education Savings
        Account (ESA) or a 529 plan. This form is used by taxpayers to fill out both federal and state tax returns if
        the distributions received are subjected to tax. A 529 plan is a state-run tax-advantaged account that allows
        you to set aside a fund for educational expenses. The institutions include elementary, secondary (middle school
        through high school), and postsecondary schools and the list of expenses includes among other things tuition,
        books, fees, room and board, and computer equipment.</p>
    <p >Both ESAs and 529s are funded with money that has been taxed. If the taxpayer used all of the
        funds distributed for qualified education expenses, nothing needs to be reported on their federal income tax
        return. If you create one of the accounts to put someone other than yourself through school, that student has no
        control over the funds and is not responsible for any of the tax consequences. 1099-Q forms must be mailed to
        recipients by February 15 and e-filed with the IRS by <span class="fw-bold">March 31st</span>each year.

    <p>A 1099-Q form should be filed and sent to the taxpayers by the officers or employees who have
        control of a
        program established by a state or qualified educational institution or anyone who has made a
        distribution from a
        529 plan. The filer whose SSN is on the 1099-Q should report the form - it could be the
        beneficiary student or
        the account owner, who may be the parent or other relative.</p>
    <p>The student/beneficiary will likely pay little or nothing on the distributions as they wonâ€™t
        have any other
        income.</br> When the filer pays a school expense with excess (other income) funds, they
        cannot claim a tuition
        deduction or either of the educational tax credits for the same expense. </br>There are
        three copies of the
        forms: one copy for the IRS, one for the Recipient, and one for the Payer.</p>

    <h1 class="py-3">The Fastest Way To E-filing Form 1099-SA?</h1>

    <p>Form 1099-SA, to report the distributions made from an:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-savings-account-hsa/" target="_blank"><u>Health savings account (HSA)</u></a>.</li>
        <li>Archer Medical Savings Account (Archer MSA).</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-upchange-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-medical-savings-account-msa-plans" target="_blank"><u>Medicare Advantage Medical Savings Account (MA MSA)</u></a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The distribution may have been paid directly to a medical service provider or to the account holder and available
        at the end of January. A separate return must be filed for each plan type. HSA are reported on Box 12 with code
        W in the W-2 Form, which includes the medical expenses. The filer may file more than one Form 1099-SA when they
        have multiple accounts. The form includes the total amount of the distribution, the total earnings distributed
        with any excess HSA or Archer MSA contributions, appropriate distribution code for the types of distribution,
        FMV of the account on the date of death, and a checkbox to choose the type of distribution or the type of
        account to be chosen by the filer. The distributions will be taxed at a rate of 20%.</p>

    <h3 class="text-color py-3">Why File 1099-MISC Online?</h3>
    <p >The 1099-MISC is just that Miscellaneous Income the IRS needs to know about for the purpose of making sure that
        self-employed people reports all of their earnings. This Form is filed so the IRS knows when someone has
        received Miscellaneous Income and that taxes shall be paid on it (assuming any are owed).</p>
    <p ><span class="fw-bold">The 1099 tax software is one of the best tools that the IRS has </span>in making sure that
        self-employed contractors
        don&#39;t underreport their earnings and are taxed appropriately. Taxes owed by self-employed are calculated
        based
        on what they have been paid during the tax year. Penalties are imposed and enforced if a hiring firm
        intentionally fails to file 1099-MISC for independent contractors. Late penalties are also imposed if a
        self-employed person fails to report income over $600 as listed on the 1099-MISC Tax Form. Due to the IRS
        receiving 1099-MISC copy A when a business files, they are aware of the amount of income paid so itâ€™s always the
        best policy to be honest.</p>

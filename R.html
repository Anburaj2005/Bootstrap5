    <p>Form 1099-R is used to report the distribution of retirement benefits such as pensions and annuities. The user
        may receive a 1099-R Form from each taxpayer to whom they have made a designated distribution or have been
        treated to a distribution of $10 or more from profit-sharing, retirement plans, individual retirement
        arrangements (IRAs), annuities, pensions, insurance contracts, or survivor income benefit plans.</p>
    <p>Form 1099-R is used to report death benefit payments made by employers that are not made as part of a pension,
        profit-sharing, or retirement plan. Reportable disability payments made from a retirement plan must be reported
        on Form 1099-R. You may also, report payments on Form W-2, Wage, and Tax Statement. If you don’t receive the
        missing or corrected form insufficient time to file your tax return, you may use Form 4852 to complete your
        return.</p>

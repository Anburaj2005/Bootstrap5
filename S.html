    <h1 class="py-3">The Fastest Way To E-filing Form 1099-S?</h1>

    <p>Form 1099-S is used to report closed sale or exchange of real estate and certain royalty payments during a
        particular tax year. Some real estate transactions can include a sale of land or exchange for money,
        indebtedness, commercial and industrial buildings, as well as residential properties, such as a home or
        condominium. The filer can consult a tax professional since the proceeds realized from a real estate transaction
        could be exempt from taxes, depending on the taxpayer&#39;s particular financial situation.</p>
    <p>If the filer received a 1099-S for the sale of a timeshare or vacation home, then the sale is a personal capital
        asset and is reportable on a Form 8949 and Schedule D. A gain on this type of sale is considered as the
        reportable income.</p>
    <p>1099-S forms must be mailed to recipients by February 15 and e-filed with the IRS by<span class="fw-bold"> March 31st</span> each year.</p>

    <h3 class="text-color py-3">Who can use Form 1099-S?</h3>
<p>If the filer is considered a buyer, they may include a clause in their purchase agreement that identifies the seller as the responsible party for any IRS reporting that is required as a result of their receipt of funds related to the transaction. The filler can also ask the seller to complete an IRS Form W-9 as part of their closing package, which will include all the information that is needed to complete a 1099-S.</p>
<p>If the filer is a seller, the seller can file for a form 1099-S since the filler would obtain the required information to file a form. A seller will also have to complete a 1096 transmittal form with all of their information if needed. A copy of the 1099 certification form is presented to the sellers at closing. Form 1099-S obtains three copies of the form the first copy will be for the IRS the second is for the Transferor and the last copy is for the filler.</p>

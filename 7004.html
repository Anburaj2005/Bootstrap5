        <h2 class="py-4">IRS Extension Form 7004</h2>
        <p><a href="./efile-7004-form" target="_blank"><u>Form 7004</u></a> provides an extension for businesses to file their tax
            return. However, any tax owed must be paid
            by the applicable tax return <a href="./efile-7004-form/7004-filing-deadline" target="_blank"><u>due
                    date</u></a> . Form 7004 provides an extension of time to file a tax return but does
            not provide an extension to pay any tax owed to the IRS. Failure to pay any owed tax will result in a
            penalty of a ½ % of any tax not paid by the due date and is charged for each month or part of a month that
            the tax remains unpaid. The penalty can be as high as 25% of the amount due. The penalty will not be charged
            if you can show reasonable cause for not paying any owed tax on time.</p>

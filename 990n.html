        <p><a href="./efile-990n-form" target="_blank"><u>Form 990-N</u></a> is used by small tax-exempt organizations
            that have an annual reporting requirement and can
            satisfy the requirements by submitting Form 990-N, Electronic Notice (e-Postcard.) <a href="./efile-990n-form" target="_blank"><u>Form 990-N </u></a>is submitted
            electronically, the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank"><u>IRS </u></a>currently has no paper
            forms to submit Form 990-N.</p>
        <p class="pt-4">Small tax-exempt organizations generally are eligible to file Form 990-N to satisfy their annual
            reporting requirement, if their annual gross receipts are normally $50,000 or less. A gross receipt is a
            total amount the organization receives from all sources during its annual accounting period, without
            subtracting any costs or expenses. If the gross receipt is over $50,000 the organization cannot file for
            form 990-N the organization must file Form 990 or a 990-EZ Form. However, if a subordinate organization in a
            group exemption that is included in a group return filed by its central organization, does not need to file
            Form 990-N because the group return satisfies its annual reporting requirement.</p>
        <p class="pt-4">If the organization fails to submit its e-postcard by the due date, the IRS will send a reminder
            to the address on file. Non-profit organizations should submit the required form, even if they are late the
            IRS will not penalize the organization for any late submissions. However, the IRS will not apply any late
            penalties due to failure of filing an e-postcard but will revoke the organization&#8242;s tax-exempt status if the
            organization fails to file an e-postcard for three consecutive years. The revocation of the tax-exempt
            status will happen after the filing due date of the third consecutively-missed year. The due date to file
            Form 990-N is every year by the 15th day of the 5th month after the close of your tax year. An organization
            cannot file an e-Postcard until their tax year ends.</p>

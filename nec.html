    <p ><a href="../efile-1099-form/efile-form-1099-nec" target="_blank"><u>Form 1099-NEC</u></a> is the newly
        implemented form for filing taxes for self-employed individuals. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/"
            target="_blank"><u>IRS</u></a> has directed that starting from the 2020 tax year, employers of labor and
        organizations will be required to use the <a href="../efile-1099-form/efile-form-1099-nec"
            target="_blank"><u>1099-NEC Form</u></a> . This will be for recording and reporting the income and
        compensation of non-employees, independent contractors, or freelancers. For payments to non-employees over $600,
        employers and business taxpayers will have to use the Form 1099-NEC.</p>

    <h3 class="text-color pb-3 pt-5">What is the difference between the 1099 NEC and the 1099 MISC Forms?</h3>
    <p>Prior to the restoration of the Form <a href="../efile-1099-form/efile-form-1099-nec" target="_blank"><u> 1099
                NEC</u></a>, the <a href="../efile-1099-form/efile-form-1099-misc" target="_blank"><u>1099 MISC
                Form</u></a> has been the sole tax filing form for employers
        for years. The <a hrfe="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank"><u>IRS</u></a> re-established the 1099-NEC Form
        after decades to make a distinction between payments to
        third-party contractors and miscellaneous income.</p>
    <p>The re-introduction of the 1099-NEC Form does not spell the end for the 1099 MISC Forms they now serve separate
        purposes. The major difference is that the Form 1099 MISC can be used to report diverse kinds of payments made
        other than business transactions between businesses and contractors. On the other hand, the 1099 NEC is
        specifically for trade or business transactions with individuals that are not on a business&#39;s payroll. Some
        of
        the payments and incentives that can be reported in the 1099-NEC Form include fees, commissions, gift items,
        awards of recognition, etc.</p>

    <h3 class="text-color">Who Uses Form 1099-NEC?</h3>
    <p class="pt-4">The 1099-NEC Form is an important form that will eventually be filed by every registered business at
        some point.
        After filing the 1099-NEC Form with the IRS, you must send your contractor or freelancer a copy. Any business
        that makes nonemployee compensation payments around $600 or more to at least one payee or withholds federal
        income tax from a non-employee&#39;s payment will now use this revamped form to report those payments and
        withholding.</p>
    <p>The IRS explains in general, that you must report payments you make if all of the following conditions apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the payment is made to an individual who is not your employee</li>
        <li>When the payment is made for services in the course of your trade or business</li>
        <li>When the payment is made to an individual, a partnership, an estate, or a corporation</li>
        <li>When the payment total were at least $600 for the year Have withheld federal income tax concerning the
            amount you pay outside contractors for the tax year</li>
        <li>Made payments for services during the process of making the business transaction or trade.</li>
        <li>Made payments for renting or buying tools for service.</li>
        <li>Have withheld federal income tax concerning the amount you pay outside contractors for the tax year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, businesses will need to file Form 1099-NEC:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When they pay an individual at least $10 in royalties, or</li>
        <li>If the business has withheld any federal income tax under the backup withholding rules regardless of the
            amount of payments for the year to the nonemployee.</li>

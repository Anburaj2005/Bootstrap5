    <h1 class="py-3">1099 Filing Requirements</h1>
    <p>For 1099 instructions regarding Forms 1097,<a href="./efile-1098-form" target="_blank"><u>1098</u></a> ,<a
            href="./efile-1099-form" target="_blank"><u>1099</u></a> , refer to the general instructions <a
            href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099gi.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> . These instructions
        include additional information about 1099 requirements, paper filing and line instructions. Filers of Forms
        1097, 1098, 1099, may be required to file electronically. Section 6011(e)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code
        provides that any person, including a corporation, partnership, individual, estate or trust, who is required to
        file 250 or more information returns, must file such returns electronically. The 250 or more requirement applies
        separately for each type of return. If 250 or more corrected returns are filed, they should also be filed
        electronically.</p>
    <p>If you are required to file <a href="./efile-1099-form" target="_blank"><u>1099 Forms </u></a> electronically and
        this requirement causes an undue hardship, you can submit a Request for Waiver from Filing (<a
            href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8508.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Tax Form 8508</u></a>) at least 45 days
        before the <a href="./efile-1099-form/1099-filing-deadline"><u>due date</u></a> of the returns. Any corrections
        for the same types of returns will be covered under the waiver if approved.</p>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note:</span> All filers are encouraged to file information returns electronically even if
        they are not required to do so.</p>
    <p>All <a href="./efile-1099-form" target="_blank"><u>1099 filing</u></a> requirements apply individually to each reporting entity as defined by its separate <a href="../efile-1099-form/irs-tin-matching-program" target="_blank"><u>TIN</u></a> . For
        example, if a corporation with several branches or locations uses the same <a href="../efile-2290-form/form-2290/employer-identification-number" target="_blank"><u>Employer Identification Number(EIN)</u></a>,
        the corporation must aggregate the total number of returns to be filed for that EIN and apply the filing
        requirements to each type of return accordingly.</p>
<h3 class="text-color pt-5">1099 Retention Requirements</h3>
